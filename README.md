# FINAL PROJECT
## ELECTRIC BILL CALCULATOR CONSOLE AND WITH GUI (VIBE CODED)
  I made the electric bill calculator in a slightly silly way because the main goal of the project is not just to calculate numbers, but to help people clearly understand why their electric bill goes up or down even when the VAT or the price per kilowatt-hour does not change. Many people get confused and immediately assume the utility company increased the rate, when in reality the difference usually comes from changes in usage time, appliance behavior, or total energy consumed. By presenting the calculator in a simple and playful manner, it lowers the barrier to understanding and makes users more willing to explore the breakdown of their consumption, helping them realize that higher or lower bills are often caused by how electricity is used, not by changes in the rate itself.
