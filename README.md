# FINAL PROJECT
## ELECTRIC BILL CALCULATOR CONSOLE AND WITH GUI (VIBE CODED)

This electric bill calculator is intentionally presented in a slightly silly and easygoing way because the goal is not just to compute numbers, but to help people clearly understand why their electric bill goes up or down even when the VAT or the price per kilowatt-hour stays the same. Many users immediately assume that the utility company increased the rate, when in most cases the real reason is changes in appliance usage, operating hours, or overall energy consumption. By keeping the interface and explanations playful and approachable, the tool reduces confusion and encourages users to explore how their daily habits affect their bill. This makes it easier to see that higher or lower costs usually come from consumption patterns—not sudden changes in the electricity rate.
